# Title: Impact of Coffee Consumption on Sleep Quality and Health

# Problem Statement:
Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages globally, and its caffeine content has significant effects on health and sleep quality. This project aims to analyze caffeine consumption levels and their impacts on sleep and overall health across different age groups. Specifically, we aim to identify daily coffee consumption levels for each age group that are unlikely to interfere with sleep quality and health.

# Phase 2: Analysis and Algorithms used

(Analysis explanation in ipynb file after each code cell )<br>

Team member 1: Algorithms - KNN (cell number - 8) , Decision tree(cell number - 8)<br>
Team member 2: Algorithms - K-means (cell number - 4), LightGBM Regression (cell number - 18)<br>
Team member 3: Algorithms - Logistic Regression (cell number - 7), Random forest (cell number - 6)<br>

# Phase 3:

The dic_p3_7.py contains the code for web app, we have executed it in anaconda command prompt using the following command : <br>
$ streamlit run dic_p3_7.py<br>
Database link : https://impacts-of-coffee-consumption-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/<br>
We have used firebase to host the dataset in real time.
